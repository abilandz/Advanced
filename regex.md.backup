### 1. What is a regular expression? <a name="what.is.regex"></a>
We have already seen that a value can be stored in a variable by explicit assignment (using the operator ```=```),  or if the user supplies variables as command line arguments (positional parameters) to a script or a function. In practice, however, one frequently wants to store the output of some command directly into the variable, or even the content of an external file. This can be achieved with the so-called _command substitution operator_ ```$( ... )```.  For instance, we have already seen that the file size in bytes can be printed with the following:

```bash
stat -c %s someFile
```
But how can we fetch the printout of above command programmatically, and do some manipulation with it later in our code? This is precis
